## What is EPA?

- **EPA** stands for *End Point Assessment*.  
- It takes place at the end of your apprenticeship.  
- Its purpose is to check that you are fully competent in the knowledge, skills, and behaviours (KSBs) required by your apprenticeship standard.  
- Your EPA result determines your final grade.

## How is EPA Assessed?

There are **two assessment methods**:

1. **Scenario Demonstration with Questioning**  
   - You’ll complete practical tasks based on realistic workplace scenarios.  
   - These cover areas such as *data gathering, analysis, validation,* and *presentation*.  
   - You will “think aloud” while working, and the assessor may ask follow-up questions.  

2. **Professional Discussion (with Portfolio)**  
   - A structured conversation with an assessor.  
   - You’ll discuss your portfolio, explain your work, and reflect on what you’ve learned.  
   - This will last around 60 minutes, with at least 10 open questions.
